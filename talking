Gameplay mechanics: As you work on implementing the gameplay for your puzzle game, you'll want to consider the core mechanics that will make up the game. This could include things like the rules of the game, the objective, and any special features or power-ups. []

User experience: As you design the user interface for your game library, you'll want to keep the user experience in mind. This could involve making sure the layout is easy to navigate, the games are easy to find and select, and the overall look and feel is visually appealing.

Testing strategy: When it comes to testing your game library, it's important to have a plan in place to ensure that everything is working correctly. This could involve manually testing the gameplay and user interface, using automated testing tools, or setting up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically run tests as you make changes to your code.

Deployment: Once your game library is complete, you'll need to decide on a strategy for deploying it. This could involve hosting the game library on a web server, publishing it as a mobile app, or making it available for download on your own website.
